Eventhough, it is not considered a city like Hoboken, Jersey city or Newark.  I guess one can considered it a town with a city feel with the number of many diverse venues.  There are also a couple of universities nearby like FDU and Drew University.  A couple of Forbes 500 companies have establish offices around the area.  ",
